        <p>Dirt Poor Robins are a Theatrical/Cinematic/Singer-Songwriting Rock band originally from Louisville Kentucky. The band consists of Kate DeGraide, Neil DeGraide, Alex O'Nan and Josh Brown.</p>
        <p>This Progressive Rock band blew me away the first time I heard 'Great Vacation' which had a certain style to it. With influences like Queen, The Beatles, Pink Floyd and Radiohead, they are if nothing else they are an extremely interesting and original band.</p>
